# go-embeddingsdb

An opinionated Go package for storing, indexing and querying vector embeddings.

## Motivation

There are many vector databases or databases with support for managing vector embeddings. This is not another one. This is, instead, an opinionated Go package for storing, indexing and querying vector embeddings independent of the underlying database using a common interface. Currently efforts are focused on the DuckDB-backed database (using the VSS extension) and a gRPC client/server implementation. The code, as writen, should make it easy enough to support other implementations but those have not been written yet.

This package and the tools it exports still occupy the in-between state of being general purpose and specific to the immediate needs of SFO Museum. That means it may not do what you need it to out of the box. If it doesn't we're certainly open to entertaining changes.

For background, please consult the [Similar object images derived using the MobileCLIP computer-vision models](https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/blog/2026/01/09/similar/) blog post.

## Documentation

At this time `godoc` documentation is incomplete.

## Concepts

### Records

Records contain individual embeddings values and related metadata. While not specific to image embeddings they are what most of the work modeling records reflects.

```
// Record defines a struct containing properties associated with individual records stored in an embeddings database.
type Record struct {
	// Provider is the name (or context) of the provider responsible for DepictionId.
	Provider string `json:"provider"`
	// DepictionId is the unique identifier for the depiction for which embeddings have been generated.
	DepictionId string `json:"depiction_id"`
	// SubjectId is the unique identifier associated with the record that DepictionId depicts.
	SubjectId string `json:"subject_id"`
	// Model is the label for the model used to generate embeddings for DepictionId.
	Model string `json:"model"`
	// Embeddings are the embeddings generated for DepictionId using Model.
	Embeddings []float32 `json:"embeddings"`
	// Created is the Unix timestamp when Embeddings were generated.
	Created int64 `json:"created"`
	// Attributes is an arbitrary map of key-value properties associated with the embeddings.
	Attributes map[string]string `json:"attributes"`
}
```

### Databases

A database is a system for managing (storing, indexing and querying) embeddings. This package aims to be agnostic to the underlying database system focusing instead on a common interface for use.

```
// Database defines an interface for adding and querying vector embeddings of [embeddingsdb.Record] records.
type Database interface {
	// Add adds a [embeddingsdb.Record] instance to the underlying database implementation.
	AddRecord(context.Context, *embeddingsdb.Record) error
	// Return the EmbeddingsDB instance record matching 'provider', 'depiction_id' and 'model'.
	GetRecord(context.Context, *embeddingsdb.GetRecordRequest) (*embeddingsdb.Record, error)
	// Find similar records for a given model and record instance.
	SimilarRecords(context.Context, *embeddingsdb.SimilarRecordsRequest) ([]*embeddingsdb.SimilarRecord, error)
	// Export the contents of the database. Where and how a database is exported are left as details for specific implementations.
	Export(context.Context, string) error
	// Return the Unix timestamp of the last update to the Database instance.
	LastUpdate(context.Context) (int64, error)
	// Return the URI string used to instantiate the Database instance.
	URI() string
	// Close performs and terminating functions required by the database.
	Close(context.Context) error
}
```

### Servers

A server is a network-based service for managing (storing, indexing and querying) embeddings. This package aims to be agnostic to the underlying server semantics focusing instead on a common interface for use.

```
// Server defines an interface for a network-based interface for interacting with an embeddings database.
type Server interface {
	// ListenAndServe starts a new server and listens for requests.
	ListenAndServe(context.Context) error
}
```

### Clients

A client communicates with a server for managing (storing, indexing and querying) embeddings. This package aims to be agnostic to the underlying client semantics focusing instead on a common interface for use.

```
// Client defines an interface for clients to interact with an embeddings database.
type Client interface {
	// Add a new record to an embeddings database.
	AddRecord(context.Context, *embeddingsdb.Record) error
	// Retrieve a specific record from an embeddings database.
	GetRecord(context.Context, *embeddingsdb.GetRecordRequest) (*embeddingsdb.Record, error)
	// Retrieve records with similar embeddings from an embeddings database.
	SimilarRecords(context.Context, *embeddingsdb.SimilarRecordsRequest) ([]*embeddingsdb.SimilarRecord, error)
	// Retrieve records with similar embeddings, for a specific record, from an embeddings database.
	SimilarRecordsById(context.Context, *embeddingsdb.SimilarRecordsByIdRequest) ([]*embeddingsdb.SimilarRecord, error)
}
```

## Databases

### duckdb://

Manage embeddings use the [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) database and the [VSS](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/vss) extension.

```
duckdb://{PATH}?{QUERY_PARAMETERS}
```

Where `{PATH}` is an optional value mapped to the location of an existing DuckDB database. If present this database will be used to instantiate the database. Depending on the size of the database this can take a noticeable amount of time. It is also the location where the database will exported to if the `Server.Export` method is called.

Valid parameters are:

| Key | Value | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dimensions | int | no | The number of dimensions for the embeddings being stored. Default is 512. |
| max-distance | float | no | Update the default maximum distance when querying for similar embeddings. Default is 1.0. |
| max-results | int | no | Update the default number of records to return when querying	for similar embeddings.	Default	is 10. |

For example:

```
duckdb:///usr/local/data/embeddings
```

## Servers

### grcp://

Create a gRPC-based server for managing embeddings-related operations. Servers are created using a URI-based syntax as follows:

```
grpc://{HOST}:{ADDRESS}?{QUERY_PARAMETERS}
```

Valid parameters are:

| Key | Value | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| database-uri | string | yes | A registered `sfomuseum/go-embeddingsdb/database.Database` URI for the underlying database implementation to use. |
| token-uri | string | no | A registered `gocloud.dev/runtimevar` URI used to stored a shared authentication to require with client requests. |
| tls-certificate | string | no | The path to a valid TLS certificate to use for encrypted connections. |
| tls-key | string | no | The path to a valid TLS key file to use for encrypted connections. |

For example:

```
grpc://localhost:8080?database-uri=database-uri=duckdb:///usr/local/data/embeddings&token-uri=constant%3A%2F%2F%3Fval%3Ds33kret
```

## Clients

### grpc://

Create a gRPC-based client for managing embeddings-related operations. Clients are created using a URI-based syntax as follows:

```
grpc://{HOST}:{ADDRESS}?{QUERY_PARAMETERS}
```

Valid parameters are:

| Key | Value | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| token-uri | string | no | A registered `gocloud.dev/runtimevar` URI used to stored a shared authentication to require with client requests. |
| tls-certificate | string | no | The path to a valid TLS certificate to use for encrypted connections. |
| tls-ca-certificate | string | no | The path to a custom TLS authority certificate to use for encrypted connections. |
| tls-insecure | bool | no | Skip TLS verification steps. Use with caution. |

For example:

```
grpc://localhost:8080?token-uri=constant%3A%2F%2F%3Fval%3Ds33kret
```

### database://

Create a client with a direct database connection for managing embeddings-related operations. Clients are created using a URI-based syntax as follows:

```
database://?{QUERY_PARAMETERS}
```

Valid parameters are:

| Key | Value | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| database-uri | string | yes | A registered `sfomuseum/go-embeddingsdb/database.Database` URI for the underlying database implementation to use. |

For example:

```
database://?database-uri=duckdb:///usr/local/data/embeddings
```

## Tools

The easiest way to build the included tools is to run the handy `cli` Makefile target. For example:

```
$> make cli
go build -tags=duckdb -mod vendor -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/embeddingsdb-client cmd/client/main.go
go build -tags=duckdb -mod vendor -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/embeddingsdb-server cmd/server/main.go
```

### Build tags

This package uses build tags to enable support for various features. The default set of tags is `duckdb` but you can override those defaults by passing in a custom `TAGS` variable when calling the Makefile targets.

#### duckdb

The `duckdb` tag adds support for the [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) database as an embeddings database.

It also uses the [duckdb/duckdb-go](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-go) package for interacting with DuckDB in Go. Although this package bundles all its dependencies in the `vendor` folder there is one notable exception: Any of the `.a` files included in the `duckdb-go` package. That is because it add a couple hundred megabytes to the overall package size. As such you will need to run `go run tidy && go mod vendor` before compiling tools. It's not ideal but it is what it is.

Note: If you need to build a binary tool with support for DuckDB for MacOS _and_ that been signed and notarized you will need to build a customized `libduckdb_bundle.a` from source. See below [for details](#statically-linked-extensions-macos).

### embeddingsdb-server

Start a network-based server for managing embeddings.

```
$> ./bin/embeddingsdb-server -h
Start a network-based server for managing embeddings.
Usage:
	./bin/embeddingsdb-server [options]
Valid options are:
  -database-uri string
    	An optional value which be used to replace the '{database}' placeholder, if present, in the -server-uri flag. This is expected to be a registered sfomuseum/go-embeddingsdb/database.Database URI
  -server-uri string
    	A registered sfomuseum/go-embeddingsdb/server.EmbeddingsDBServer URI. (default "grpc://localhost:8081?database-uri={database}&token-uri={token}")
  -token-uri string
    	An optional value which be used to replace the '{token}' placeholder, if present, in the -server-uri flag. This is expected to be a registered gocloud.dev/runtimevar URI that resolves to a shared authentication token.
  -verbose
    	Enable vebose (debug) logging.
```	

For example:

```
$> ./bin/embeddingsdb-server -server-uri 'grpc://localhost:8081?database-uri={database}' -database-uri 'duckdb:///usr/local/data/embeddings' -verbose
2026/01/17 06:24:58 DEBUG Verbose logging enabled
2026/01/17 06:24:58 DEBUG Set up database
2026/01/17 06:24:58 DEBUG Statically linked VSS extension installed and loaded
2026/01/17 06:24:58 DEBUG Load database from path path=/usr/local/data/embeddings
2026/01/17 06:24:58 DEBUG IMPORT DATABASE '/usr/local/data/embeddings'
2026/01/17 06:25:40 DEBUG Finished setting up database time=41.931554166s

2026/01/17 06:25:40 DEBUG Allow insecure connections
2026/01/17 06:25:40 INFO Server listening address=localhost:8081
```

_Note: Did you notice the "Statically linked VSS extension installed and loaded" message in the example above? This is NOT the default behaviour (which is to install and load the `VSS` extension on the fly, downloading it from the DuckDB servers as necessary). See below [for details](#statically-linked-extensions-macos)_

## DuckDB

### Statically linked extensions (MacOS)

If you want to build a `emeddingsdb-server` binary (or any other tool that uses this package as a library) for MacOS with support for DuckDB _and_ that has been signed and notarized you will need to compile a custom `libduckdb_bundle.a` library with both the JSON and VSS extensions statically linked. Then you will need to use specify that custom library when building the `emeddingsdb-server` binary. This is because the default behaviour for DuckDB is to load (and cache) extensions on the fly and those extensions will have been signed by someone other than the "team" (you) that notarized the `emeddingsdb-server` binary.

_Note: The following instructions will work if you don't care about notarizing the `emeddingsdb-server` binary but still want local, statically-linked extensions that don't require a network connection to use._

After a fair amount of trial and error this is what I managed to get working. It _should_ work for you but you know how these things end up changing when you're not looking.

First install both `duckdb` and `vcpkg` from source:

```
$> git clone https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb.git /usr/local/src/duckdb
$> git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git /usr/local/src/vcpkg

$> cd /usr/local/src/duckdb
```

Now copy the `vss.cmake` config file in to the root directory:

```
$> cp .github/config/extensions/vss.cmake ./vss_config.cmake
```

Now edit it to remove the `DONT_LINK` instruction. For example:

```
duckdb_extension_load(vss
        LOAD_TESTS
        GIT_URL https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-vss
        GIT_TAG c8a4efe05003d8ef6eaad34f5521cf50126c9967
        TEST_DIR test/sql
        APPLY_PATCHES
    )
```

Ensure the following environment variables are set:

```
$> printenv

GEN=ninja
BUILD_VSS=1
BUILD_JSON=1
EXTENSION_CONFIGS=vss_config.cmake
VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/usr/local/src/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
VCPKG_ROOT=/usr/local/src/vcpkg
```

Note the use of the `BUILD_JSON` environment variable. This will bundle the JSON extension which is necessary to use the VSS extension.

Now build the command line tool so you can verify that the VSS (and JSON) extensions are statically linked:

```
$> make

... stuff happens

$> du -h /usr/local/src/duckdb/build/release/duckdb
 43M	/usr/local/src/duckdb/build/release/duckdb
```

Once built, check the installed (and loaded) extensions:

```
$> /usr/local/src/duckdb/build/release/duckdb

DuckDB v1.5.0-dev5476 (Development Version, 1c62e11b82)
Enter ".help" for usage hints.

memory D SELECT extension_name, loaded, installed, install_mode FROM duckdb_extensions() WHERE installed = true;
┌────────────────┬─────────┬───────────┬───────────────────┐
│ extension_name │ loaded  │ installed │   install_mode    │
│    varchar     │ boolean │  boolean  │      varchar      │
├────────────────┼─────────┼───────────┼───────────────────┤
│ core_functions │ true    │ true      │ STATICALLY_LINKED │
│ json           │ true    │ true      │ STATICALLY_LINKED │
│ parquet        │ true    │ true      │ STATICALLY_LINKED │
│ shell          │ true    │ true      │ STATICALLY_LINKED │
│ vss            │ true    │ true      │ STATICALLY_LINKED │
└────────────────┴─────────┴───────────┴───────────────────┘
```

Assuming that the `vss` extension is installed and loaded build DuckDB again as a library:

```
$> make bundle-library

... stuff happens

$> du -h /usr/local/src/duckdb/build/release/libduckdb_bundle.a
 79M	/usr/local/src/duckdb/build/release/libduckdb_bundle.a
```

Apply additional MacOS hoop-jumping, appending the `generated_extension_loader.cpp.o` file to the `libduckdb_bundle.a` file::

```
$> find /usr/local/src/duckdb/build/release -name "generated_extension_loader.cpp.o"
/usr/local/src/duckdb/build/release/extension/CMakeFiles/duckdb_generated_extension_loader.dir/__/codegen/src/generated_extension_loader.cpp.o

$> ar rcs /usr/local/src/duckdb/build/release/libduckdb_bundle.a /usr/local/src/duckdb/build/release/extension/CMakeFiles/duckdb_generated_extension_loader.dir/__/codegen/src/generated_extension_loader.cpp.o
```

Finally rebuild the `embeddingsdb-server` with the customized DuckDB library using the handy `server-bundle` Makefile target (in this repo):

```
$> cd /usr/local/src/go-embeddingsdb
$> mkdir work
$> cp cp /usr/local/src/duckdb/build/release/libduckdb_bundle.a ./work/

$> make server-bundle
CGO_ENABLED=1 CPPFLAGS="-DDUCKDB_STATIC_BUILD" CGO_LDFLAGS="-L./work -lduckdb_bundle -lc++" \
	go build -tags=duckdb,duckdb_use_static_lib -mod vendor -ldflags="-s -w" \
	-o bin/embeddingsdb-server cmd/server/main.go
```

_Note: You don't have to copy `libduckdb_bundle.a` in to a local `work` folder but this way you don't have remember where it is or what happened to it the next time you clean up your `/usr/local/src` directory. The `work` directory is explicitly excluded from Git checkins in this repository._
